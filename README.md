## résumé

This is my Open Source résumé. That's right. You are welcome to fork it, send a pull request, create an issue and do with it whatever you want.

_Note_: The project is still experimental and not recommended for production use. :)

### Contributing
The résumé is built by contributors (otherwise what's the point of making it open source?).

How to contribute:

1. Fork it
2. Make some changes
3. Commit them
4. Send a pull request
5. Optional: you can easily delete the fork ([see here how](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/)).

You can change pretty much anything though the additions are most welcome. The structure, content, etc. is up to you. Be creative, if you think I miss something create an issue and I'll fix myself or learn something new (I would appreciate a test case)! Don't be too serious, it's not Linkedin after all.

Oh, btw, *I will buy every contributor a beer* :)

Here we go! ⬇
